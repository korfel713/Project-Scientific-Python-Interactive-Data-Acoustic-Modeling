IMPORTANT
ANY PYTHON VERSION OF 3.12 OR ERIRLER SHOULD WORK, BUT IF YOU RUN INTO PROBLEMS THE CODE WAS PROGRAMED IN 3.12 SO TRY THAT VERSION.

Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling (SPIDAM) Project Overview

The SPIDAM project aims to develop an interactive data analysis and modeling platform for assessing and optimizing voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces. By analyzing reverberation time (RT60), the project identifies problematic frequencies and proposes acoustic solutions to ensure consistent and clear sound across the audible spectrum (20 Hz â€“ 20 kHz).

The application leverages Python and scientific libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and LibROSA, and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless interaction.

using the model of view, model, and control files the code was degined to pop up a gui when being runned and ustilzing the buttons display the required info and graphs to the corisponding audio files that are downloaded.
