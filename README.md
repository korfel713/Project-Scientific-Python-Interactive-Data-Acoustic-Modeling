Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling (SPIDAM) Project Overview

The SPIDAM project aims to develop an interactive data analysis and modeling platform for assessing and optimizing voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces. By analyzing reverberation time (RT60), the project identifies problematic frequencies and proposes acoustic solutions to ensure consistent and clear sound across the audible spectrum (20 Hz â€“ 20 kHz).

The application leverages Python and scientific libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and LibROSA, and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless interaction.

currently their is a problem where the gui pops up twice, and you must first press the download button, then in the second gui that will pop up, press selct file, and selct the audio file. after that press donwload again, and then the buttons will work perfectly, with the note that one of the two guis will be dead, so no need to use it.
