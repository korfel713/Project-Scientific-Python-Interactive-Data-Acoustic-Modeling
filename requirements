import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from tkinter import *

for the download file you needed to download os and pydub to use the following imports
import os
import pydub

for the control file you needed to download pydub, wave, matplotlib, numpy, tkinter, scipy to use the following imports
import pydub
import wave
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import tkinter as tk
from scipy.signal import spectrogram

finally for the Model file you needed to download os and pydub to use the following imports

all of these imports are required to be able to run the code properly.
if the code is not running then it most likely means one of these were not downloaded right as the code is in fully functioning order.
